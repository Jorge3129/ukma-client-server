## Homework 2

Here I have 3 modules: **packet-service** contains the logic of packet processing (it's taken from the previous assignment),
**store** contains data storage logic, and **server** is the main module dealing with multithreading.

Although I implemented encryption and decryption, I commented out their use (in **packet-service**) because I kept getting an error that the bytes are padded incorrectly.
